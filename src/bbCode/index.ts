/*
# staffCode

The `staffCode` script converts text codes for sheet music notation elements into SMuFL unicode
characters. You can use it to type things like:

a4 nt4 c5 nt4 e5 nt4

and see a chord displayed on a staff.

This script will find all elements on the page matching the CSS selector `div.staff-code`
and convert their `staffCode` from text to unicode. A modified version of the Bravura Text font
from Steinberg MediaTechnologies GmbH, designed by Daniel Spreadbury, is used to display as sheet
music notation. This project would not have been possible without the great work done on Bravura
Text, and its precursors Bravura and SMuFL. For more information see https://www.smufl.org/fonts/.

// TODO: BUG, LOW PRIORITY: NO "FLASH OF UNSTYLED CONTENT" ON THE FORUM
//  We need to know when a font has finished loading before doing the above replacement
//  In order to do that, either use a library like this: https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery-fontspy
//  Or `document.fonts`: https://makandracards.com/makandra/31499-detecting-when-fonts-are-loaded-via-javascript
//  Or these: https://portalzine.de/dev/options-to-detect-when-a-font-face-has-been-loaded/
//  This: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5680013/how-to-be-notified-once-a-web-font-has-loaded
//  Or this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FontFaceSet/load
//  `document.fonts.ready.then(()` did not work btw
//  It's only a problem the first time someone loads a page on the forum, so low priority

// TODO: NEW FEATURE, READY TO GO: ALLOW FOR USERS TO CONFIGURE WHICH FONT IT USES
//  Probably in the HTML replacement somehow, yes, as we discussed, just give it the inline style there
//  Maybe provide a demo where you unnecessarily assign it to Bravura Text BB
//  Or intertwine this with the to-do about styles
