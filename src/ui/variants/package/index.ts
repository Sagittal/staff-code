// TODO: BUG, READY TO GO: [STAFF] SCALING ISSUE
//  But the comparison between [_]sc] and [_]staff] has now brought to my attention that the output of [_]staff]
//  Is only 7/8ths of the size it should be. i.e. there are only 7 pixels between staff-line centres
//  When there should be 8. The web app is fine. It has the expected 8 pixels.
